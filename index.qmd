GNSS Expert | Tech Transfer and Innovation | Software Development

## Expertise

My technological expertise covers

- Global Navigation Satellite Systems technology, from algorithm definition to implementation. My main expertise covers Navigation algorithms as well as ionospheric monitoring using GNSS.

- GNSS data analysis

- Terrestrial and Alternate Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) systems (e.g. Wi-Fi Round Trip Time and other range-based systems such as 5G and Ultrawide-Band)

- Software development (from proof-of-concept to production based systems based on Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)

Other relevant skills

- Technology transfer and Innovation

- EU tender and grant proposal preparation and evaluation

- Project management

## Short bio

I am a GNSS Research Engineer with over 20 years of experience. I holds a BSc in Telecommunication Engineering (1999) and a PhD in GNSS Data Processing for Ionospheric Monitoring (2004) from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (Spain).

I have a diverse career spanning academia and industry, and have held key positions at renowned institutions, including:

- **Rokubun**: CTO and co-founder position of Rokubun
- **JPL/NASA**: Technologist positgion, doing GNSS data processing for navigation, geodesy and orbit determination, as well as implementing physical models for the next generation GPS control segment
- **Starlab Barcelona**: Space Program and Area Manager, executing projects related to GNSS data processing for Earth observation as well as GNSS receiver development.
- **DLR**: Scientific saff at the GNSS Technology and Navigation group of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), developing GNSS systems for LEO applications.
- **University of Kyoto**: Post-doctoral position for one year in the Research Center of Sustainable Humanosphere (RISH) on data combination for ionospheric monitoring,

I am also an associate editor in the [GPS Solutions](https://link.springer.com/journal/10291) journal.
